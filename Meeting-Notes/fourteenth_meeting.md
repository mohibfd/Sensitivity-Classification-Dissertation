# What did I achieve

Implemented dropdown and pagination on all pages

Set up XGBoost with application and connected it with ELI5, LIME and SHAP

Attempted to set up SVM with application but so far no success because of issues with shap

Fixed issues with github version control

Automated files in the info page to decrease waiting time

# discussion

change name of general sens to Collection Sensitivity analysis

change size of plots of matrix and stuff

heading before each one to give a bit of information

can control the predictions of classifiers

highlight that classifiers disagree and asking for their input

think of the highlighted words that they deem as most important

make lime and eli5 consistent

allow user to dedice which classifier's features are important

allow user to make a decision for each classifier

add option to have document with no highlighting instead of lime and eli5

ask them whether the document is sensitive or non sensitive without the text highlighting.

You want them to tell you which features represent their decission

the highlighting is extra aid.

does the highlighting of the text help the user choose the right feature set

!!have a draft of the user study plan!!

what is it you want to evaluate in the system? what is it that you want users to do? what documents are you going to use? how are you going to record the results? through logins or online surveys? any components that need to be in place to do the user evaluation that are not already there? what needs to be done to actually conduct the user study? how are you going to get user?
