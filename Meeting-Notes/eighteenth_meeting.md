# Discussion

In the conversation to the lead up in the aims you have to discuss why you are doing multiple different types of classifiers / explanations. You have to do it from the perspective of the user.

What is the task that you are helping the user to do, why is it important using different classifiers/ why is it important that there are multiple classifiers.

The emphasis should be on how multiple classifiers assit the user

focus more on the user and what they want to do and how would classifiers help them do that and why is multiple classifiers more useful than a single classifier

classifiers and explanations are kind of interchangeable (in the feedback I am getting)

why are multiple more useful then single classifier

you are interested in the set of different possibilities of predictions

which sets of documents do all the classifiers agree are sensitive or non-sensitive

You are more confident when all classifiers agree

discuss when classifiers disagree

if they disagree it is a more difficult judgement to make and therefore you need to know which of the explanations are the most helpful

In background/related work you are jumping straight into machine learning, you need to go first to the task and look at the similar research available. What are they inted to do, what is the functionality they give the user? Importantly what don't they have that is the gap you are trying to fill?

how does my system help the user do the task and why is my system different from mine than others and I should reference those later

Afterwards you can go into the machine learning stuff

Machine learning should come before machine learning explainablity, I am not doing that

The high level thing is the classifiers and then more specific thing is explanining those types of classifiers

Could seperate machine learning explainability into

-  machine learning
-  machine learning explainability

you could probably only dicsuss explainability once, no need to repeat yourself

always have text in every section before their subsection basically between 2.3 and 2.3.1

you'll have your background about the task first
make 2.2 supervised classification

introductory text about classifiers

2.2 should be the high level stuff about classifiers
2.2.1 should be the low level stuff

2.3 should be the high level stuff about explanations
2.2.1 should be the low level stuff for explanations

flask framewokr is an implemention detail. The model view controller is the architeture. REST API would be the architecture. It is an abstract model of how to implement a system. Like flask is a particular implementation choice. You choose to use them to implement the model view controller. It is a RESTful interface. It will be a model-view controller architecture. It's a standard architecture for web development. You will have an architecture diagram showing the components. You will have a user as a stig figure and you will have arrows showing the inputs/proccesses/and outputs. A good way to do is it to label each compoent (square or rectange) and you will have a component say for classification or prediction. You label each of these and in your introduction to the architecture chapter, you say figure 3.1 for example presents our architecture and then maybe have a subsection for the overall architecture. You can use the labels in your diagram as a structure for your next sections. In each of these sections you can give an overview of what it does, what its inputs are and what its outputs are. You also have your user interface and things like that.

In your implementation chapter, you should mirror it so that the structure is the same as in your architecture section. The diagram will act as a roadmap for the next chapters.

in experimental setup start with the research questions yo uare trying to answer. What is the dataset your are using, some information about the number of documents, how many sensitive and how many non-sensitive.

You have to talk about the dataset and how you developed the classifiers using the dataset. maybe these should be in the implementation.

Developing your classifiers is somehting you had to do to get your system working. That will be quite seperate from your evaluation and testing chapter. At some point you will have to present your system.

Maybe at the end of the implementation system you can give the overall of how everything works and screenshots of what the system looks like. Showing off your system.

I think the development of the classifiers would come before that, because you have to develop the classifiers to have the system working and showing these things to the user. Which will be the screenshots of your user interface.

You might not need experiment setup section, you will need an testing (unit testing) and user evaluation (user evaluation) ..

have a section for developing the classifiers and their results in the implementation (cross-fold valiation) and the results and stuff like that. And then after that you are talking about the user interface.

have a good full draft by next week
