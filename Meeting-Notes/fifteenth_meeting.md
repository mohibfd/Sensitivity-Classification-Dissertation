# What I achieved

Created balanced LSTM (it was biased towards classifying all documents as non-sensitive)

Set up Cross validation for LSTM

Fixed pickling issues with LSTM

Fully implemented LSTM into the app with LIME and SHAP. However, turns out ELI5 is unable to make explanations for textual deep learning models, only images. Therefore, LSTM only has LIME as available visualisation

Currently writing draft for user study plan
