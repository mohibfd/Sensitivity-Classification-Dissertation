Add heading before matrix and SHAP plots

Highlight that the classifiers disagree and ask for user input
Allow user to decide for each classifier on whether they are correct or not

Allow users to decide which classifier’s highlighted words are most important

Ask user whether the document is sensitive or non-sensitive without text highlighting

Check whether the text highlighting helps users with their decision making

What is it you want to evaluate in the system?
I want to evaluate whether the explanations made by lime and SHAP help the user’s decision making. Which classifier was the best at predicting?

What is it that you want the user to do?
I want the user to tell me whether the visualisations are helpful in their decision making.
Qualitative, what about quantitative: if you ask them to do a task, you can see whether they can get that task correct, see how long it takes them to do it, see which features they use to do it. You can log some numbers that you can make plots out. Collection level questions

What documents are you going to use?
2 Sensitive documents, 3 non-sensitive documents. One from each classifier

How are you going to record the results?
In website data storing as well as questionnaire survey.

Any components that need to be in place to do the user evaluation that are not already in?
Need to implement user input and highlighting when classifiers disagree

What needs to be done to conduct the user study?
Contact 10 people, friends or acquaintances and ask them to use the platform.

How are you going to conduct it?
Physically, I will allow them to conduct the experiment on my laptop since there does not seem to be enough time.

Do they get the decision correct more ofthen when using classifier than without

Number of people, tasks, order of tasks, information I want to collect

Write instructions to give them an introduction for the user study, tell them what they are going to do. Checklist? Do checklist and you’ll see some details in the instructions document, that they can stop any time they want and that no personal details are going to be collected about them.

Have instructions in survey
