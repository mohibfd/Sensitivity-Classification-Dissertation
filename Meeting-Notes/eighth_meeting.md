# Summary of where I am:

End to end system is created, user can enter website and login to find information about a specific document or see the f1 score and confusion matrix of the model.

model is using logistic regression with lime.

automated tests are created for the different features of the website.

# Main approaches I am focusing on now:

I will put less focus on the deep learning models as I need to focus on the visualisations and improving interpretability of the already existing logistic regression model.

I want to automate and have the models and explanations saved since currently opening pages is slow.

Cross validation so user can see all available documents.

ensure test data is not 50/50 to prevent bias.

I want to ensure that the website is fully usable and that the model is comprehendable as soon as possible.

# What I want to achieve:

Website that is user friendly and displays useful information about the model's decision making.

Potentially refocus on model choice and improving the overall score.

Ensure 100% testing for all the features of the website
