# What did I achieve:

went over the entire tutorial codebase to understand it

read about styling in css and html

set up the different urls for the website (following the wireframe)

added lime visualisation into web page

setting up github and gitignore for the data

cleaned up model's code and undersampling the data

attempted to set up sql database for document numbering

# Questions:

# Plans for future:

think of seperating the lime text

lime documentation

svm, search tree?

esnemble classifier?

naive bay/forest/svm
probabilistic/tree based/geometric

cross validation gives only 1 document

one of each family?

deep learning

which deep learning approacehs are feasible for classifying full text (long documents) and whether they are integretable with lime.
the other option is to learn it on passages then predict it on the passage level then accumulate it to the overall document prediction.

fasttext?

investigating this is very important.
