# Questions

Should I put background information near end of dissertation?

Should I start preparing the video and powerpoint presentations?

How do I discuss BERT and some of the other architectures that I have tried?

Data science website referencing style, (with parenthesis or without)?

Is it fine to use all of these images as long as I am referencing them?

# Discussion

yes do them from now.

Relatievely similar structure to thesis

aim for 10 minutes, a minute a slide around 10 slides max

it will be uploaded to moodle later today

can read through what is sent on teams

If there is relevant outcomes from it then we can put it in

When discussing classifiers and the classifiers you have you could discuss that you tried some deep learning models etc.. however because most deep learning models are focused on short text and coz we have to run on long test documents we came into technical issues with memory and since developing novel classifiers is not the main focus of the project since it is explaoining we decided to stick with the ones in there. could reference that document that mentioned the bert issue. We thoguht it was worth giving a go anyways but in conclusion we agreed with the authors that it is more trouble than it is worth.

put time and effort and energy into what actually worked until you're reasonably content iwth the full draft of the dissertation and there are no big gaps. At the polishing stage and if there is something worth having then look at it then. The bert thing is quite good though since it is answering a question that the reader might have. By saying that you did and quoting that referencing and the complexities of it and that you agree with the author and that you agree, you are answering a specific question that the reader is likely to have.

if putting a footnote no need to reference the eli5 and 2017

google colab is not an architecture. It's a tool.
