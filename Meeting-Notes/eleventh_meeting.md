# discussion

think of it in a user's perspective, what the user will understand

change website to have light background

have the lime overview, some sort of overview from the eli5

allow the user to be able to change the text highlighting.

keep the overview of shap and lime in the same page

frontend -> lime change -> classification -> shap
