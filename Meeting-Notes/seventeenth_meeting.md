# What I achieved

Ran user evaluation for 2 users

Implemented improvements they suggested

Attempting to deploy website online

# Questions

best way to start?

video submission?

# Discussion

discuss that you had 2 user studies

start by doing a table of contents, you will have sections and subsections, just the title of it.

Within each of those, put bullet points in each of them about what you are going to cover in that section or subsection

The main point of it is to start developing the structure of the narrative

Top down aproach, bullet points and multiple level bullet points

I rearrange the bullet points so that they flow in good order

You can reorder the bullet points until you get a structure of the narrative that you want to emerge

polish it after a couple of iterations until you're happy with it

do then a bottom up approach, tackling it from 2 ends?

start from the start (introduction) and write it sequentially

you will have tables of classifiers and that kind of stuff,

tables of results that you're going to put in and screenshots and diagrams and things like that

doing the big chunks that diagramatically, numerically etc.. present the main saliant? kind of content that you want to present.

The most important thing is to read what you write separatly from when you write it

maybe look at it from a different app or device. Actually read it and try to be objective when you read it

Try to read it as someone who's coming not knowing anything about the project

there is a template on moodle and there is a structure, you don't have to stick to it strictly but do what's best for your project

examples from hall of fame, change the dissertation and adapt it to your project

you get more detailed as you go in the section, that goes with the high level introductions etc..

implementation section goes into more detail and implementation etc..

you always go from higher level into more in depth as you go

each section or subsection follows on from the previous one and builds on it

running examples are always useful to explain things to readers

about 8 minutes, 10 minutes video

basically an advert for your product

might be sort of 8 slides

you have an introduction to the task

what is the particular issue that you are trying to tackle

what are you trying to fill, what is your insight or hypothesis

getting across the story of the project in the first 3 slides or something like that

you mention some design decisions

mention that you followed good software practices

in the video you want to demonstrate your app and show that it's working and show it off and say how amazing it is

worth putting effort and doing it well to give them a good idea about the project

you are looking for the salient points that highlight your project

!
send dissertation a day before so you can read it
