# What did I achieve:

-  Implemented saved model into flask instead of having to retrain

-  fully implemented cross validation with the dataset that way more than 20% of the data can be used

-  Used full data instead of undersampled data so that the user can skim over 3800 documents

-  Balanced the model that way it isn't biased towards non-sensitive documents (since no more undersampling)

-  Ensured that user can skim over all documents with no issues

# Questions

-  Remind supervisor of resources for more ram?

-  Ask about showing project to interviewers

-  Mention flight

-  We can see vs it is visible

# Discussion

start looking over the resources for the cluster

create dummy documents for interviews

consider doing a phd to get into ml focused jobs

put a bit of effort into the plan of next semester

think about what the priorities are and what you want to get into

give user the option of what visualisations they want

get multiple classifiers (svm, forest)

try to potentially get bert?

create a user evaluation

send report and put it on moodle

mpm3 for visualisations?

find something other than lime and shap? get extra points for diss

mlp3 for interactive plots?
