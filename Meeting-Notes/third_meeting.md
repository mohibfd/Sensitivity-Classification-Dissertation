# What did I achieve:

Exported all the data from the files and made them into a panda dataframe

Saved the dataframe for quicker access (that way I wouldn't need to crawl over the files each time)

Trained the model using logistic regression (with onehot and tf-idf) and also random forest

Set up latex on computer and added timelog to version control

Read more about lime and shap

Set up basic lime and shap visualisation

updated wireframe (https://www.figma.com/file/2qQgHB1fgEhSeKYf2WanMz/Level-4-Project?node-id=0%3A1)

Pickled logistic regression model, one hot vectorizer, and features for quicker access

tested multiple inputs for LIME

# Questions:

Should I add in the timelog when I was sick?

would having an inbalance in hours between this semester and next semester affect my overall grade?

Should I change anything in the wireframe?

# Plans for future:

Improve model's predictions

Improve visualisation for both lime and shap

provide initial overall general statistics about the collection itself, the distribution of sens vs non senti, types of classifiers.

cross validation?

if 5 cross validation which one will you choose
multiple classifiers?

get average score based on all 5 folds

downsampling?

start working on backend of website

remove stopwords

changing requirements?
