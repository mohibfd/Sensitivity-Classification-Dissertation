# What did I achieve:

Read the two papers discussing sensitivity classifiers

looked at most suitable web framework for backend (Leaning towards Flask)

looked at gensim, spacy, mpld3, lime, textblob, scikit-learn

read articles about e-discovery with nlp

Created initial MoSCoW method.
Must have: Classifier for sensitive data; visiualization as to why the model decided sensitive or non sensitive; user input telling the model whether it is correct or incorrect to improve the model further; high level of security.

Shoud have: Good user interface for optimal user experience; High speed when running different actions in the website that way the user does not have to wait; user gets feedback as to how their response improves the model

Could have: Create new state of the art model that beats previous best model

Will not have: unsure at this stage, will update later

Created wireframe for website (https://www.figma.com/file/2qQgHB1fgEhSeKYf2WanMz/Level-4-Project?node-id=0%3A1)

Read papers about model explanation

found SHAP which is a python library similar to LIME

# Questions:

The project lecture advised to not write code for anything that will not benefit the dissertation. I am a bit unsure what that means

Is my MoSCoW method accurate or does it need changing?

Is there anything that needs changing in the wireframe that I created?

Should I attempt to start creating the model or should I research more?

# Future plans:

Start building the model by utilizing some of the frameworks and libraries discussed. The plan is to set the foundation of the model.

# discussion in meeting:

To be added during the meeting
