# Discussion

discuss software based

add a sentence as to what it enables the user to do and htat it identifies documents that are difficult to judge and multiple explanations strategies

what the added value is of multiple classifiers

maybe I should say now, since it takes as input a collection of documents, it passes through a preprocessing step which does x yz. It's your first step, what I did, our preprocessing. The system should be the focus of. it is the system that takes in the data and does the preporcessing competing

that's the experimental design, user study: experimental design

user study: results

merge them into one chapter, a section for experimental design

and 2 components within that,

a section for user study results

make the headings reflect the sort of main thing you want to get across.

comparing participants sensitivity judgments against the ground truths

include moscow and user study. at some point when suitable in the dissertation you ahve to explicetly state that you have succesfully completed your must have, should have

requirements chapter before the architecture chapter and label each of these requirements.

Your set of must have requirements bullet points, MH1 document classified sensitivity
MH2 explanation
MH3 user-friendly
SH

you should excplicitly state that this feature implements requirement MH1, MH2

you can discuss that these findings show that your system does and that you've done it

In your future work stuff, best not to focus on the could have and should have. You don't wanna focus on these things, you wanna mention it for transparancy. For your suggestions for future work, the suggestions should come from either suggestions from the users in the users study and your own new ideas based on what you've learned throughout the project

Requirements chapter inside back and arch chapter. In that you start off with your user stories. In discussion with the client (project supervisor) we discussed a number of scenarios in which our perspective users would be using our applications and based on these conversations we come up with these user stories, having developed these user stories we boiled it down to a set of requirements for this, and the next section it would be moscow requirements. You would have a bulleted points list with must have coiuld have should have, in the first level of indendation, in your section indentation you would have MH1. Your wireframe could go after the requirements, that you developed this wireframes. You would do the wireframes before you designed the architecture. It fits somewhere between requirements and architecture. Fix the bottom 2 and move them to the side. you have plenty of space to make it wider.

Go and check the marking guidelines, use that as a double check to make sure that you covered all the things that you need to cover.

make 4 different bullet points groups for moscow

add in a couple of points (1 or 2) from ther user study.

Your conclusion is a bit small

Mention that you have 54 tests and that they all pass
