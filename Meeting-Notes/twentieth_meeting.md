# Discussion

Aything about the software engineering process when developing the system? requirements gathering, maybe user stories? you dive straight in talking about lime without discussing what lime is. There is no notion upfront about why multiple classifiers might be beneficial for a user. There are many things that are not explained at the start of the video. Take a couple of minutes to set the scene first. Think of it like you're adhering to good software engineering practices to find out what is good, what is needing done, what do the users want to do. What are the difficulties that they face. This is the gap, this is the hole that we are filling, these are the requirements that we have identified. Show the reviewing process, like users stories, to show that you gathered information about the context that they'd be working in to lead up. 'to be able to help users with this task we identified 2 things, firstly providing multiple classifiers will help to identify documents that are hard to make judgment on'. And most importantly we want to provide explanations as to why the classifier thinks a document is sensitive or non sensitive. Not all the explanations are the same, therefore we give different types of explanations to assit them with their sensitivity judgments. Build it up more before diving straight in.

you've got 2 slides with papers, maybe instead of discussing the papers. setting the scene, from a software engineering perspective, what is the task, what do we want to do. Showing that you've done some sort of requirements gathering, user modeling whatever. I would try and have the architecture diagram so that you can say some reviewers are doing it remotely so we made it deployed, it's not just about the interface and the user. You want to show quite a rounded sort of project. not just showing off the app is important but also showing off the project. If you can, try to get some software engineering processes at the start and setting the scene. At the end of it when showing the results you could put some plots. ensure that you mention that you did a user study and how many users were in the study. Results of what? include this in one of the slides and talk through it. You don't have to say logisistic regression, talk about it from the high level generic perseptive. That tells the leader that there is a sophisticated system behind this. Just put a couple of graphs that you think are interesting. Quick headline thing, whatever allows you to get across an interesting. You can have two of these plots at the top of the slide/side by side and some bulletsp oints underneath it.

Figures look very big, I would look to see how you can better use the space because if you've got very large figures than it looks like you're attempting to use up space, potentially use them side by side and pair them off, the related feagures. you need to work on your latex skills by reducing images, you don't necesarilly have to see the text. it is taking up too much space. Try it smaller then we can work from there. Remove the documents from appendiceis. potentially reducing appendices. Some of it can be reduced. That might be good in the main thing. You need to fight latex. This an orphan, you can't have an empty page just because you have online over. how do you make it so that the user enjoys reading it. When you make these figures, make sure you crop any white space around it before importing it into your latex document. Make confusion matrices smaller. how much information is in that figure, what can I do to give it the space it deserves? woould It be better just doing a table and creating it yourself. You might be better just doing a table.
